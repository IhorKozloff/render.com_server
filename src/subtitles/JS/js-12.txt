in this video we'll talk about iteration

statements iterations allow us to loop

through a body of code a block of code a

number of times until a certain

condition is met and there's a couple of

different types of iteration statements

we'll look at two in this lesson and

we'll even look at them in relationship

to arrays something I promised several

lessons ago so let's start off by

creating a new file and call it

iterations j/s and inside of here we'll

create our first for loop so for and

then there are three parts inside of the

opening and closing parenthesis first of

all we'll let I equals 0 or we can

actually just shorthand this and not

even use the key word let and here I

less than 10 I plus plus and so this is

gonna take some explanation but let's

just get this working first and then

I'll come back and I'll talk about it

and we'll just print out the value of I

alright what do you think is gonna

happen here if I didn't tell you

anything about how the for loop actually

works what do you think will be printed

to screen when we execute our script

let's find out so let's go here and type

in you know the iterations alright so we

get a several it looks like 10 different

values printed to screen each on a

separate line 0 through 9 and then our

application exits all right so let's

talk about this it's a shorthand syntax

and there's three parts as separated by

these two semicolons inside of this this

evaluation header for the for first of

all we declare variable in this case

I've declared I that's why we use the

Lett but then I said oh you don't really

don't need it let's keep it short so

we're declaring it and then we're going

to initialize its value to 0 the second

step we're gonna say continue running

this for loop as long as this condition

is true so as long as I is less than

and continue running the body of this

four loop as defined with this set of

curly braces here and then finally after

you've run an iteration increment the

value by by one all right and here we're

going to then print out the value and

that's why we start at the value of zero

and then we work our way all the way

through this ten times on the tenth time

I gets incremented to ten this this

check is performed it's false and then

we exit out of the program all right now

let's do something a little bit more

interesting like I suggested before let

me comment this out here let's go let a

equal to and this should look familiar 4

8 15 16 23 and 42 look I guess I forgot

the equal sign there and now what we'll

do is for I equals 0 I is less than a

dot length I plus plus inside the body

this will do console.log a and what

element well we use I because I will

start off with the value of zero and it

will continue until we get to the length

property which is not zero based and

once we get to for example the 0 1 2 3 4

5 so length will be 6 elements so once

is 6 it's no longer true that I is less

than the length of this array and will

exit out so let's go and save this and

then run and we can see we get all of

our values printed out to screen so

that's the proper way to iterate through

or one way I should say to iterate

through an array now one thing about

visual studio code that I really love is

that they have this notion of code

snippets so if you ever forget this this

syntax and it can be a little daunting

at first

there's a way to remember it perfectly

every time and that is to let the code

snippets build it for you so I type in

the for keyword intellisense pops up a

little window under it and I'll use the

arrow keys to go to the for loop

JavaScript alright there's a couple of

fors

but the one that we want has this little

box with dots underneath of it that

tells me that this is a code snippet I

hit enter on my keyboard and now I get

the basic structure of my of my for loop

already created for the purpose of an

array now notice that every word index

is highlighted and I can change that

every instance of that by just using a

letter like I'm gonna change this to the

letter B instead of index and notice

that it changed it everywhere and then

I'm gonna hit the enter key on my

keyboard which is the wrong move then

I'm gonna hit the tab key on my keyboard

and I can change the name of the array

now everywhere the word array is used I

can swap that out with the letter A for

example I'll use the tab key one more

time here it puts me to the another

replaceable area for the element and

here all you see I'll use to have one

more time and then it kind of exits me

out of that snippet replacement

structure and now I can continue on a

type like console.log that'll just print

out C okay so let's grab a from our

previous example and then we get the

same results we got before but this time

we didn't have to memorize exactly how

to use for the code snippet walked us

through and allowed us to replace the

names of the various replaceable areas

like the name of the counter the name of

the array and the name of the given

element C that we extract out of out of

our of our

arrey okay just come at that out that's

four and now let's take a look at the

while loop so we'll talk about the

difference between these it may not be

obvious at first but essentially we'll

do this alright so take a look at this

knowing what you know about loops what

do you think is going to happen here

well we start off with one and we're

going to continue to execute this loop

until this condition is false so the

very first time we run it one is indeed

less than ten so we'll continue to run

the body the block that's associated

with our while statement and we'll print

out the value of x and then increment

its value by one we'll continue to do

this until we increment the value of x

and it becomes ten

at which point this is no longer true

becomes false and then we'll break out

and continue on so let's go ahead and

see what value what what the value is

that we get so we get one through nine

that's expected and once we hit ten we

break out great alright so what's the

difference between the while statement

and this first for loop that we did here

at the very top well the difference is

that the for loop first of all has a lot

of infrastructure that we have to build

these three pieces and it uses a series

of indexes that represent the number of

iterations that will move through this

block of code now the while statement a

little bit different anything can be

used to derive the iterations as long as

this statement continues to be true will

continue to execute this block of code

and so we control the number of

iterations in the body in this case here

I do the X plus plus now we don't have

to use counters we could use anything

any kind of business logic like we may

want to read to the end of a file and

once we hit the end of the file it no

longer it makes sense to continue to

read each line of the file

we would want to break out so the while

is a little bit more flexible and so

much that we can build a business logic

for how many times we're going to

iterate in the body of the the while

statement whereas with the four we're

pretty much limited to the number of

times we want to run this being the

number of times that we've kind of

preset it up here in this top section

outside of the body itself okay now

there's also one less thing we can talk

about and that's a way in both the four

and the while we can kind of circumvent

this check right here and we may want to

do a check like this so if X is equal to

seven then we'll call the break

statement

all right so learning what we've learned

about the if statement it probably

should look more like that all right so

let's first of all let's make sure it

works in this case we've got one two

three four five six once we reach the

seven we circumvent this check and just

say hey I want to break out of this all

right so we can use that always to break

out just like we broke out of the switch

when we want it to not let it flow

through additional cases now the one

thing I will say if you notice how I

type this to begin with let's retype

that so hold on let me comment this out

so that you can see it in the code if

you want to download my code but we

could also do it a little bit more

shorter and inline since I only have one

statement that I want to make right

after the if statement I can do it on

the same line and I don't need to

surround it with a code block a code

block indicates that there's usually

more than one line of code in this case

there's just one line of code I could

put it on the separate line and use some

indentation like that or I can just keep

it all on the same line since it's so

short but that might improve readability

or I might decide that this is a more

readable form that's kind of up to me

and if I'm working on it with a team of

software developers I might want to get

and kind of do it the way that they do

it but stylistic for me this is so short

I can read it all in one shot

if X is seven then break out of it it

just it looks good it's very readable

I'll be able to understand what I'm

doing later on it doesn't take up and

move the code down so I like that that

format if I just need to create one

statement right after my if right after

my if so sometimes it makes sense to

split things on separate lines sometimes

it makes sense to keep two different

statements on the same line again I

think it kind of is a stylistic choice

that you'll you have to make for

yourself at some point alright so that

is iteration statements we've looked at

two different kinds and we looked at how

code snippets can be used to help us

remember the format now I believe the

while has in fact I believe most of the

things that we've looked at has some

some code snippets available to them

like if I find it here and intellisense

they hit enter on the keyboard but

there's not as much to it there I mean

while with the condition I can change

this to X is less than 10 right it's not

so much for me to type that out but the

4 makes a little bit more sense because

there's so many parts to it and

replaceable parts of that okay so let's

continue on in the next video we'll see

there Thanks
