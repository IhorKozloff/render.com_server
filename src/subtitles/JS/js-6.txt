in the previous video we learned that

values not variables have a data type

and that the data type is essentially a

description of what you want to do with

the data there's more to it than that

but for our purposes right now it's

essentially what we intend to do with

the data and we were learned of four

data types and we'll learn about a

couple more a little bit later there's

the number data type the string the bull

and the undefined so let me ask you this

what happens when we need to use them

together and they don't quite work the

way that we think they should what

options do we have then

so let's go ahead and create new file

I'm gonna call this coercion Co ER cion

dot yes I think that's how you spell it

and let's start off with a quick little

example here so let a equals 7

let b equals the string the literal

string so I want to use single quote six

single quote all right and then let's

see equals a plus B and then console dot

log answer and then C all right before

we execute this application what do you

think is going to be output when we run

it what will the answer be all right get

that in your mind and now let's go node

and coercion and looks like we don't get

anything at all oh I need to say fits ok

there we go let's try that again

there we go we get the answer seven six

wait seven plus six should be 13 right

why are we getting 76 something I can

see what's happening it's not treating

these as two numeric values it's

treating them both as string values so

it's not adding two numbers together

somehow it's coercing that a from a

string in from an integer into a string

and then concatenating together a and B

so this operator the plus operator we

saw how we can use it for addition but

we also it plays double duty and it's

the string concatenation operator but

moreover JavaScript realizes that it

can't add a number in a string those are

it's like adding you know an apple and a

car together it's not like making an

apple and an orange even these it's not

like fruit salad it's like two

disparately different things what do I

do well I will I will take the numeric

value and coerce it convince it force it

against this will to become a string and

then I will concatenate the two together

so that's the notion of coercion and

most people consider that to be an evil

thing or a very dangerous thing and

others just say well it's just what

happens you know it's as part of the

language

now what if I really wanted to perform

addition on two integers well then I

would need to take steps to force the

string 6 to become a number so that I

could then add them together and so to

do that there's actually a special

function that will force that conversion

so let me change this just a little bit

and we already have the value B so I'll

just reuse the value B and I'll set B

equal to parse int now I want you to

notice something I haven't really talked

about visual studio code much but one of

the nice things about visual studio code

is that it popped up this little box

called intellisense and intellisense

is just a visual cue as I'm typing to

show me things that I might need to

reference or things that will help me to

to find the right command or the right

idea in this case I knew it was

something parse

so I start typing in and I can then use

the arrow keys to start looking at like

oh yeah there's poor parsefloat that

would give me a number with decimal

values but this in this case the the

string that I want to use I know that it

will only be a value without without any

decimal point so I want to use the parse

int now what I can do is just use the

space bar or like the opening

parenthesis whatever the next logical

character is to do what's called code

completion so I don't have to type

everything else now in this case I know

that I'm gonna need to use the

parenthesis for reasons I'll talk about

later so I'm just gonna do an open

parenthesis well didn't do it for me

well there we let's just go ahead and

use the tab key instead all right so the

tab key will give me what I want now I'm

inside the the parenthesis that I need

to pass in first of all the string that

I want to change so in this case take

the value of B and then I need to give

it optionally what's called a radix or

radix and that is essentially the base

system so if I wanted to to use like a

hexadecimal I might give six but in this

case I'm gonna give it ten because I

want to eat a base ten or a decimal

conversion all right so it lets a little

technical but typically if we use ten in

there we're going to be just fine so

essentially what I want to do is take

the six and based on the normal decimal

system I want to convert that into a

numeric value and then I want to

continue on in lines four and five like

we had before let's see what we get this

time the answer is 13 just as we had

hoped all right so the parse int is a

built in function to JavaScript and I

can count on it being available in node

or in a web browser or any other

implementation of JavaScript all right

so I guess this begs the question what

if I try to do something kind of evil

with this so let D equal parse int and

then we use the tab key to do the code

completion

and this time I'm going to pass in a

character that will not convert to a

hora or even a string that will not

convert into a numeric value especially

one that's decimal so I'm gonna save

this well let's go ahead and console

that login and D so let's go that this

alright and I get n a n which represents

not a number it's not really an error

it's just telling us that the value we

passed in is not a number we could

actually do something along these lines

as well let e equals is an a N and then

I can give it some numeric value in this

case I'll give it D and I'll become sold

log E save that run it again and so this

time now I'm evaluating whether D is not

a number and that is true it is not a

number because I can see it here that's

printed out all right so we saw two

built-in functions but there's a bunch

of built-in functions for various things

all kind of centered around in this case

just working with coercion and checking

the results of that attempt to to coerce

or or convert one data type into another

alright

unfortunately there's no parse boolean

so you can't take a string of true or

false and converted into a boolean

you'll have to take a few extra steps

there's a bunch of examples online for

that and so depending on the type of

conversion that you're attempting to to

perform it may not be easy to convert

from one to the other there's always a

way and usually you can find some code

online especially on a site like Stack

Overflow that will help you figure that

out but that's all I wanted to say let's

continue on in the next video we'll see

you there Thanks

you
