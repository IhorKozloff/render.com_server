all right so let's get started we're

gonna install the tools that we're gonna

need for the remainder of this course

fortunately we don't need a lot and

everything is free and everything I show

you will work regardless of which

operating system you currently have

installed so regardless of whether

you're using Windows Mac or Linux

everything I show you will be available

for those platforms the first thing

we're going to need is a web browser I'm

pretty sure you already have one of

those installed any will do I would

probably recommend that you either use

Microsoft edge or you use Google Chrome

the second tool that we're gonna need to

install is node it is the JavaScript

runtime it's what will actually execute

the code that we write and we'll talk

about that more in just a moment and

then we're gonna need an authoring tool

something where we can actually type the

code in now in the past I've used

notepad to actually demonstrate cuz I

didn't want to like you know recommend

one tool over the other but then

Microsoft came out with Visual Studio

code it's available on all three

platforms so it's also available for

free so no matter what you're using you

should be able to download and follow

along now you may already have a

favorite tool for creating web pages and

so forth feel free to use that I'm not

gonna do anything that's so Visual

Studio code specific that it will

exclude you please follow along no

matter what tool you prefer but let me

put in a good plug for Visual Studio

code I've been using it pretty much as

one of my exclusive tools in my

full-time job

for the last three months and it's it's

really good so I highly recommend it

let's get started

we're gonna need node and you may

already have node installed so let's

just see if you do or not let's go and

in Windows I'm gonna open up a command

prompt and I'm gonna type in node dash V

if I had node installed it would display

the version of node that I currently

have installed I don't have node

installed on this computer so I get an

error message that's good so to begin

we're going to go to node

jas I can type there we go

no js' org and again regardless of which

operating system you're using you should

be presented with an opportunity to

download either the supported version or

the current version which has like the

latest features you don't need that just

just use the LTS version which is

recommended for most users as long as

you're using the version that I'm using

or greater we should always be in sync

again we're not going to use any really

advanced features of note so this

shouldn't really matter much I'm gonna

go ahead and run it run the Installer

here what you see next depending on

which operating system you're using

will you may see something a little bit

different than what I see on screen but

hopefully you've installed things

frequently enough that you can work your

way through it so here we have the

node.js setup wizard and I'll just walk

my way through agree to the license I'm

going to pick a place on my hard drive

to install this there are some options

I'm not going to really do much of

anything but I do want to make sure that

in Windows that this is added to my path

this will make sure that note is

available in any directory of my hard

drive so when I type in node V from

anywhere in my command prompt it'll

it'll pop up ok so just make sure that

everything is selected you'll be fine

it's not that large next I'm gonna have

to agree to Windows UAC you might see

something different here on the Mac or

Linux I'm gonna go ahead and agree to

that little security prompt and it only

takes a minute or two to install node

and then we'll move on but basically

node in a nutshell is the v8 JavaScript

engine that they ripped out of Chrome

they added some tooling around it to

support things for like HTTP working

with with requests and responses and

with the file system and they created

one of the most robust web server tools

that is

available today and many large

applications are using node currently to

host their applications we're not going

to use it for that we're gonna use it

for something much more mundane which is

to really just write out little text

messages to a console window as we get

started

then we'll graduate on and use it in

webpages and much later in this course

alright so I should have it installed

right so I come over here and it still

says it's not installed I'm gonna have

to reboot my computer so let's pause I'm

gonna pause the recording of the video

right here I'm gonna reboot and then

want to come back in we should be able

to move on from there all right so I've

rebooted let's open up a command prompt

type in no - V and I can see the version

number so we're successful the next step

is to install Visual Studio code Visual

Studio code is different than the full

version of Visual Studio so Visual

Studio community professional or

Enterprise Visual Studio code is a

lighter-weight code editor mainly used

for web development but I know people

that use it to develop c-sharp

applications and other type of

applications where you can use the the

command line tools to compile your code

and things of that nature that's not

something I would ever want to do it's

great for web development and that's

what we're gonna use it for for

authoring our JavaScript files and then

executing node commands in a built-in

little command window command prompt

like we see there again available for

all operating systems you just go to

code Visual Studio comm it should be

able to detect which operating system

you're currently using and it gives you

a download option for that alright and

we're gonna go ahead and run it in place

again windows UAC prompts me to make

sure that I am authorized to install it

we get to the to the code setup wizard

I'm gonna go ahead and accept the

agreement and we're gonna work our way

through the defaults sure and you can

see that we can also add Visual Studio

code to the path which will become

available after restart I don't need

that necessarily for this course but hey

you know it doesn't hurt in fact let's

go ahead and

use it for everything here that's up to

you

you can read those options and choose

what you want but for my purposes this

will work just great

and we'll see throughout this course

some of the things that Visual Studio

code will do for us as we're typing our

our code simple things like like code

coloring and code completion managing

our files giving us an environment to

execute command line tools like the node

command line tool and there are many

things like that

intellisense others that will give us

the tools to to hopefully allow us to

author our JavaScript code accurately so

let's go ahead and launch it and let's

just do what I call a quick smoke test

and we don't need get for this course

I'm just gonna hit close on that so what

we'll do is go to the Explorer it's the

little icon in the upper left hand

corner here let me kind of pull this out

and make this a little bit sized a

little bit more nicely here great I'm

gonna close down the welcome screen I am

going to click open folder and I'm gonna

go on for me I'm gonna go to my C Drive

and I'm gonna create a source folder now

depending on your operating system or

what your preferences are you may want

to create a folder somewhere else but

create a folder because we're gonna put

some some JavaScript files and later

some HTML and CSS files in that folder

and we're gonna want a folder structure

so right here in the open folder dialog

I'm going to right click and select new

folder I'm gonna call this source lower

case s and source and then select that

folder and now that becomes the working

folder then I'm gonna use to add

additional files and and all the work

that we do for this course inside of

there it doesn't really wants me to put

get install git and I don't want to do

that what I really want to do is go to

terminal

alright and depending on which operating

system isn't your installed on you might

see something different here in Windows

you see PowerShell doesn't really matter

as long as you get a command

prompt and here I'm going to type no - B

and I can see that that's awesome and

then what I want to do is add a file

inside of this folder this working

folder so I'm gonna click on this little

file with a plus symbol in the upper

left hand corner I'm going to type in a

pas and it opens up a new file here in

the main area with a little J s icon

right next to it and here I'm going to

type all lowercase console dot log hi

I'm gonna go to the end and hit a

semicolon so let's kind of walk through

this the word console a period on your

keyboard the word log L o G and then an

opening and closing parenthesis inside

of there I want to put an opening single

quote mark and a closing single quote

mark and then some word I've put hi you

could put your first name it really

doesn't matter but what does matter to

me at least is that you end it with a

semicolon and as you're gonna come to

learn writing code is an exercise of

precision if you don't write exactly

what I write there's a chance that you

will not get the results that I get and

so you want to double check and make

sure there's not extra spaces you want

to double check to make sure that you're

using the right characters like this is

not a comma it is the period on the

keyboard

all right this is not a curly brace it

is a parenthesis this is not a double

quote although that would be acceptable

in this particular situation I would

prefer if you used a single quote which

is on the same key you just have to hold

down the shift key alright to get to it

all right so now I'm gonna use ctrl s on

my keyboard to save or it might be

command s if you're on the Mac or

something else on Linux I don't know

whatever you you use but or you can just

go file save all right now watch what

happens when I just use the spacebar on

the keyboard did you notice see that

little symbol there it went from X to a

circle that means that file has not been

saved yet that change that I made is not

saved

so here again

I'm gonna use the keyboard shortcut to

save it then I'll come back down here

into the terminal now how can I do this

easily well on Windows the keyboard

shortcut is ctrl and then the back tick

that's usually next to the number 110 it

to the left of it on most keyboards so

the back tick will close and open up

that little terminal window at the

bottom and now I can type in node space

and then I want to use the name of this

file so app dot J s and hit enter on my

keyboard and it should print out that

word hi that I have inside of those two

single quote marks in console dot log

all right now we can also shorten this

up node space app we don't have to use

the file extension and it will work as

well all right so assuming that you were

able to follow along and you got to this

step then you're ready to move forward

and we're ready to get started actually

writing some JavaScript let's start that

process in the next video we'll see

there thanks
