hi my name is bob tabor and in this

course you'll learn about JavaScript the

language this course is aimed those who

are absolute beginners so beginners to

JavaScript and frankly given that we're

gonna discuss some very basic things

like if statements and for loops it's

really designed for those who are

beginners to programming in general so

if you know some HTML and some CSS and

you want to learn JavaScript awesome

you're in the right place

also there's nothing specific to Windows

in this course the tools that I use will

be free and available in Mac and Linux

as well so you should be able to follow

along no matter which operating system

you're comfortable with using now my

background is really not all that

important but in case you're curious I

am a software developer by day and by

night I run a website called developer

university or dev you you can visit me

at dub dub dub dub you comm occasionally

microsoft invites me to create courses

and what you see here is a collaboration

between myself and the good folks at

Microsoft Virtual Academy I've been

creating courses like this since 2004

and I created a very successful version

of Java JavaScript course way back in

2011 it's been viewed millions of times

and I've got a lot of very positive

feedback about it this is a rewrite a

complete rewrite of that course because

frankly JavaScript has changed

dramatically in the what six or seven

years since I originally recorded that

course and so if you're already a

software developer coming from a

different programming language just kind

of pick back up what I said earlier this

might move a little bit slow for you it

just wasn't designed with you in mind

there might be some other courses that

can move you through the the

introductory material a little bit more

quickly than what I plan on then then

the pace that I plan to take with this

course and my focus is the JavaScript

language the pure language not web

necessarily although we will discuss

javascript in the context of the web

browser at the very end of this course

but I felt like teaching JavaScript and

how its implemented in the web browser

clouded the discussion of JavaScript the

language itself so we're gonna be

writing what amounts to console or

rather command-line style applications

to isolate JavaScript the language as

purely and simply as possible without

clouding it with a bunch of HTML and CSS

and things like that we're gonna discuss

the language will discuss popular

patterns that have emerged from the

JavaScript development community to help

overcome some of the challenges

associated with working with such a

highly dynamic language such a unique

language and sometimes kind of a quirky

language the last time that I recorded

the course about JavaScript way back in

2011 the the course actually had a

fairly long shelf life and so much has

changed with JavaScript since then that

I assess it ated that I actually play

catch-up and kind of learn some of the

new features that were added because I

wasn't keeping my skill set up that's

how quickly things change out from under

you if you're not careful if you know

anything about JavaScript you know that

the community around javascript is

moving extremely quickly it's the most

popular programming language not just in

the web browser where there are hundreds

of JavaScript frameworks and libraries

that you can leverage in your own

applications

but it's also becoming one of the most

popular languages for server-side web

development meaning the code that

actually runs on a web server that can

perform business logic that can interact

with data storage databases and and

other styles of data storage and we're

not going to talk about any of those

topics in depth per se but it is

important to know that it all starts

with a basic understanding of the things

that we will discuss in this course the

absolute basics of JavaScript so since

this core

may have a long shelf life it's

important to know that some of the

features of the latest version of

JavaScript which I will be covering in

this course may not yet be implemented

in all web browsers depending on when

you view this course and then you have

to take an account that some of the

people viewing your website for example

might be using very old web browsers and

so you have to keep that in account as

well so I'm gonna make two general

suggestions and I'm gonna try to remind

you about these at the very end there

are so people on the internet that are

viewing webpages with browsers that were

created 10 years ago so clearly in these

cases the newer features of JavaScript

many of which we'll discuss in this

course will not be available in those

browsers and your JavaScript won't even

work in those web browsers so you have a

choice at that point you can you go one

of two routes you can either attempt to

write your code in such a way that it is

is as friendly as possible to those

older web browsers or you can use a tool

which will transpile your JavaScript

code that you write using the latest

features of JavaScript

it'll transpile it back into a version

of JavaScript that is compatible with

all web browsers even those that were

built 10 years ago and it uses a

combination of techniques to accomplish

this we're not going to get into any of

those but if you want to take the first

tact if you want to be careful with the

JavaScript that you write and only use

those those original features I guess

you can say of JavaScript oh they're

early features of JavaScript there's a

website for you you want to take a look

at this website called can I use and so

we can take a look at maybe one of the

newer features of JavaScript to let

keyword I'll type it in here in the

search box can I use and it will show us

the let keyword gives a quick

description of what it is and then it

will show for the current versions of

each of the web browsers whether it's

supported or not you can see that the

let keyword does have wide adoption

across all modern web browsers with a

couple of exceptions now if you want to

go ahead and use the apps

latest version of JavaScript and then

take that second tact where you

transpile your code so that it's come

backwards compatible with as many

versions of the various web browsers as

possible then you want to check out a

website like and a tool actually called

Babel j/s so you can find it at Babel J

SEO and it will again use a combination

of techniques to to take your code you

can see some of this little animation

that's on the page right now you can

actually use this to type in some code

here and see how it converts it into the

older style JavaScript and I'm not going

to cover how to use Babel in this course

but you should know up front that

writing JavaScript for web browsers

requires that you give some careful

thought to how your JavaScript will

ultimately be consumed and who your

targets are and that definitely means

that you're gonna have to take into

consideration the fact that some people

will be using older web browsers a

writing JavaScript that will run on a

web server using a framework like nodejs

is a bit easier because well you're

gonna have some some upfront knowledge

about where that code will ultimately be

executed but this is not a course

specifically about nodejs either even

though we're going to use nodejs as a

lightweight means of executing these

little tiny JavaScript examples that

we're going to create throughout this

course so you're gonna learn enough

about nodejs to be able to write a

simple tiny application but it won't do

anything cool like serve up a web page

however i'm sure there are other courses

here on Microsoft Virtual Academy and

elsewhere that will help you kind of

take that next step so the game plan for

this course is to start in the very next

video by installing the tools that

you'll need to get started and then

we're going to start with the absolute

ABCs of JavaScript and programming in

general and I encourage you to follow

along by typing in the code that I type

in the video and that's you know typing

it yourself is the absolute best way to

learn

starts to develop muscle memory you'll

have many of those aha moments where you

realize oh I see how these two things

are related you can hear it and that's

one thing but to type it in and the see

it on your own computer working is

something entirely different I highly

recommend that you you become an active

learner by typing in the code yourself

but I encourage you also to pause and

rewind the video as many times as you

need this isn't a race

you don't consume these kinds of videos

the same way you would watch a TV show a

movie or a YouTube video if something's

not clear to you don't just let it go in

one ear and out the other and worry and

say I'll figure it out later

no stop down and figure it out now

because you never know it might be

something foundational you'll need to

know in the next lesson in the next

lesson but by the end of this course

you're going to be well-positioned to

move on to a more advanced JavaScript

course to learn how to use modern client

frameworks like react and view and

angular or you'll be well-positioned to

learn more about server-side frameworks

libraries frameworks and libraries like

nodejs and Express Jas and others but no

matter what you're gonna have a great

foundation to build on if something I

say doesn't make sense again I can't

stress this enough seek out other

sources online and you're gonna

ultimately want to know something from

me I've recorded enough of these courses

I know the questions that are already

coming you're gonna ask me if there's a

book that goes along with this course

that I could recommend and I'm sorry I

don't really have a specific

recommendation honestly my

recommendation is that you exhaust the

dozens if not hundreds of JavaScript

online resources where you can simply

use them for free and find them in an

instant if you want to get more

explanation about any given idea that

are that's covered in this course ok so

let's go and get started I want to

encourage you to take your time don't

feel overwhelmed stick with javascript

stick with this course and you're gonna

be well rewarded I promise it'll be more

difficult than playing a video game then

watching movie or reading a book but I

promise you you're gonna wind up

enjoying it even more than any of those

things even if I wasn't paid to write

code

would do it because it's fun it's

mentally challenging and you get this

rush whenever you you write code and you

see it working and you're like wow this

is awesome so I'm glad you're gonna get

an opportunity to do that it's the most

fun you're gonna have on a computer I

promise and you'll you'll wind up

enjoying it so stick stick with it and

I'll try to encourage you along the way

alright so we'll get started in the next

video see you there Thanks
