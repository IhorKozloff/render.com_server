in this video we're going to talk about

the values that we store in variables

and we're going to talk about the types

or rather the data types of those values

and why they're important so to begin

with let's go ahead and create a new

file called data types dot j s and this

is where we're gonna do all of our work

and one of the things that makes

JavaScript so unique when compared to

other programming languages is that

whenever you declare a variable like we

do here let X equal 7 the variable

itself does not have a data type only

the values that we store inside the

variables have the data type so we kind

of see this whenever we're working with

variables we can use something called

the typeof operator and this will tell

us the data type that we're working with

so well let's go ahead and go back to

here let X equal 7 so let's start off by

just doing console dot log and then

we'll say type of all one word lowercase

and then X and let's save that save it

and here I'm going to type node and then

data types and you'll see that it

outputs a number so that's one of the

first data types the X data type is a

number and a data type is really just

the kind of data that we want to store

so if you want to perform math or some

algebraic operation then you want to use

a number and if you want to do a yes or

no true or false evaluation then you'll

want to use a boolean and if you want to

display something on-screen then you'll

want to use a string which is basically

a shorthand for string of characters and

you usually represent those with single

quotes with whatever string of

characters you want to to use inside of

it so let me give you a few examples

here we've

I looked at number let y equal true and

so then we'll do console dot log type of

Y and then I'll just go ahead and do Z

as well let Z equals a little world and

then console dot log Z whoops not to Z I

want type of to see alright and so now

let's go ahead and run this and we can

see that we get the three data types

that we're currently working with a

number of boolean and a string so in the

case of a number it can be any positive

or negative number it can even have

decimal values in the case of a boolean

it can either be true or it can be false

those are the only two values and then

if we want to create a string it's going

to be anything inside of the single

quotes it's a literal string of

characters but I literally want

h-e-l-l-o space wo rld alright and so

those are your three of your seven basic

basic types data types

there's also another case let's let a

and then console.log the value of a and

then console.log type of a alright and

just to remove the confusion here I'm

gonna use a multi-line comment this

allows me to avoid having to do this on

every line right I can just do this

little slash star at the top and go down

to the bottom of where I want to comment

out and then star slash you can see

everything that's highlighted in green

or turn to the green color is now

commented out just as if I commented out

each individual line separately so here

I'm just creating a variable a but I'm

not initializing it to a value remember

we saw do you remember what it output

when we did this

for it output the value undefined but we

want to see what the type is because we

said that it's the the value that's

assigned to the variable that has a type

so what is the type of a variable that

has nothing assigned to it well that's

what we're gonna get to the bottom of

right now so we see that the value is

undefined and the type is undefined so

now we have four types we have number

boolean string and undefined and there's

two or three others that we're gonna

look at here before the before the very

end we'll get to them they're a little

bit more complex but those are the four

that we can have to work with at least

to start off with and so that's all I

really wanted to say the next thing

we're gonna talk about very quickly is

how I would convert one type into

another type how do I force JavaScript

to treat a string like this console.log

and then a literal string of the value 9

how do I make it treat it like the

number 9 well we'll talk about that in

the next video we'll see there thanks
