up till now each variable that we create

can store one value at a time per

variable but what if we need to work

with lists of data in other words I need

to keep track of several people or

several numbers and I need to store them

in such a way that it doesn't matter if

I have two or ten or a hundred I can

kind of keep them together and move them

all around and use them in my

application as a list as a grouping of

related values in that case I want to

create an array and so let's start by

creating a new file called arrays jas

and first of all it's basically an array

is basically a variable that can hold

many different values and so we can

declare variable and initialize its

value like so so here we'll do let a

equals and here we're going to use an

opening and closing square brace or

bracket and then I'm going to give it a

series of values each value will be

separated by a comma for eight let's say

15 16 23 and 42 all right and so now I

have an array of those values now these

are just numeric values what if I wanted

to create an array of string values I

knew something similar in fact I can use

any data type inside of here that's

allowable in JavaScript and we'll see

some examples of that a little bit later

but I might want David Eddy Alex and

Michael okay and then what if I want to

get one of the values that you just do

console dot log all right inside of here

I'm gonna use the variable name so in

this case I'll use a and then I want to

provide a index to retrieve one of the

elements so each of these is an element

of the array and I want to use an index

a numeric value that that allows me to

get at one of those elements inside of

the array the indexes are zero-based

that trips up beginners sometimes you

for example to get at the number for the

first element in the array I would use

the index 0 if I want the second item in

the array the second element of the

array I would need to use the index 1

and so on so to get at it I'm going to

use a and then right next to the a

square brackets and now I'm gonna give

it an index so here we'll grab the first

value and then I'll grab the second

value and then I want to do show you how

console dot log will just print out all

of the values for you nicely if you just

want to give it the name of the of the

array itself the the variable itself so

let's save our work and we'll go node

arrays all right so you can see the

first element of the array at index 0

gives us the value for the second

element of the array at index 1 gives us

the value 8 all right hope you can see

the correlation there or if I just want

to print out all the values in the array

I can just provide the variable name

that contains the array and it will

print them out for me just like I have

and up here when I actually initialized

our array variable alright let's come in

this out now that is how we access

individual elements what if I wanted to

change or set the value of one of the

elements the same would work so in this

case I would say for example a 0 and I

would set it equal to 7 like so and so

then we can just use console.log like so

and then we run our application now you

see the first element the array has been

changed from 4 to 7 because that's how

we can access a single element and

assign it a new value

all right so what about these mysterious

these mysterious arrays what is their

data type so let's do console.log type

of a and we can see that it's of type

object and we'll talk about the object

datatype later because there's a lot

more to it than just being able to

create a raise

but it's a little bit more advanced at

this point we'll get into it soon just

keep in mind that an array isn't a data

type of itself it is a type of something

called object and we'll talk about

objects later all right

so the other thing that's important to

remember is that a array can and can

include elements of different data types

so let me just do let's see equals we

started with four and then we'll do Alex

and then we'll be true all right so

we've used three different data types

right there and we can just do note rays

oh I need to actually do a console log

see there we go there we go all right so

you can see that a single array can hold

different data types there's no

restriction there let's come at that out

what happens if I try to access an

element that within with a index that

does not exist so let's do console log

and I happen to know that the B has four

different elements in it for names and

let me try to access the fifth element

by using the index four

and this will be undefined so just like

a variable without any value assigned to

it is undefined so is a element of an

array undefined if we don't give it a

value now I can also just

programmatically determine the number of

elements in an array by using a special

property called length so I can do

console.log a dot and remember the dot

is the member access operator so arrays

are objects and this particular object

has a special property called length

which will give me the number of

elements in that array so I would expect

to see let's see one two three four five

six so the question is is there going to

give us six the actual number or is it

going to give it us to it in a

zero-based fashion and the answer to

that is that it will give us the actual

number not zero based and this will come

into into play a little bit later when

we use the length of an array and we

iterate through each element of the

array to print them to screen when we

learn about looping alright so just keep

that in the back of your mind now

there's a lot of strange things that you

can do with with arrays and some of them

are not always intuitive like for

example if I wanted to just randomly

create a new element so in this case I'm

going to create what the use the index

10 which means this would add an 11th

element to the array what happens with

all of the elements between where we

left off 0 1 2 3 4 5 so 6 through 11

what will we get so let's just assign

this to 77 and then I want to do a

consult

log of a and then I want to do

console.log and a dot length like we

just learned about and kind of see

what happens here and then let's run

that all right so we can see that it

prints out four five six seven or I'm

sorry 4 8 15 16 23 42 and then it says

there's four empty items and then

there's 77 and it says that there's 11

there's eleven items 11 elements in this

array because we filled up the tenth

index or index 10 with a value so it

will create essentially what's called a

sparse array and that means that there

are empty elements inside now this isn't

usually the way that you want to work

with arrays if you need to add new

values because it's not as safe we're

inadvertently creating elements with

nothing in them there's a safer way to

go about this using some additional

built-in functions of the array and so

if I wanted to add that value and add it

to the end of the array no matter how

many elements are currently in the array

I could use the push method and so I say

hey I want to push the number 77 to the

end of the existing array so let's sum

let's copy this and paste it here and

then if I wanted to remove it I can use

a method called pop so this function pop

will remove the last element of the

array in fact I can call it several

times to keep removing elements of the

array and here we'll just print out what

the end result is just like we did

previously so now this should put some

fireworks into our terminal window so

you can see that using push in line

number 29 I was able to add the number

77 to the end of the existing array and

that gives me seven total elements now I

call pop three times it removes 77 42

and 23 leaving us with just four

elements in our array okay so we're

going to continue to use arrays they're

a great way to to keep lists of things

together and accessible and will become

even more important again as we learn

how to loop through arrays and to

evaluate each element

we can even use a raise to hold on to

other things like like objects and

functions and learn about some advanced

to use cases with arrays a little bit

later all right so that's all I have to

say about arrays let's move on and start

looking into some things that are beyond

the absolute basics we'll start moving

and talking about functions all right

see there Thanks
